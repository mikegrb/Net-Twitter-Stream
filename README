NAME
    Using Twitter's streaming api.

SYNOPSIS
     use Net::Twitter::Stream;
     # Create "track" connection with a list of keywords.
     Net::Twitter::Stream::Track->new ( $username, $password,
		      'ffa,football,soccer,yankees,mashchat,mashable,tinychat,perl,memcached,nginx,javascript,talkabee,f136bc2d9f24,hackernews,reddit,clojure',
                      \&got_tweet_callback );
         # Create "follow" connection with a list of user ids.
         Net::Twitter::Stream::Follow->new ( $username, $password,
                           '27712481,14252288,972651,679303,18703227,3839,27712481',
                           \&got_tweet_callback );

         # Start listening
         Danga::Socket->EventLoop;

         sub got_tweet_callback {
             my $tweet = shift;
             print "By: $tweet->{user}{screen_name}\n";
             print "Message: $tweet->{text}\n";
         }

DESCRIPTION
    Twitter recently allowed access to a streaming version of their api. The
    api is currently under "alpha test" release, but hopfully it will prove
    scalable and become the normal way to suck data from the twitterverse.

    Here is an example of how to use the api. In particular the code
    connects to a track and a follow stream. Once connected the data flows
    from server to client until something goes wrong.

    Danga::Socket is required for event based network I/O and to manage
    multiple connections. I run this on a Mac and use Net::GrowlClient to
    display tweets as they come in but that can be easily changed.

    HTTP Basic authentication is supported so you will need a twitter
    account to connect.

    As far a I can tell twitter only allows one connection per IP.
